Kotlin Implementation of Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## Background

This project is based on my earlier project [Java Implementation of Neural Networks and Deep
Learning](https://github.com/pwall567/nndl-java) and is an attempt to implement in Kotlin the
example code from the online book
[Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by
[Michael Nielsen](http://michaelnielsen.org/).
The earlier project has more explanation of my intentions; this project is an exploration both
of Neural Networks and Kotlin.

This Kotlin implementation is currently a work in progress.
